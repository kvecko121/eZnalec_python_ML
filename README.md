This is a second part of my machine learning project. 
I am using my own data scraped from real estate website (2025).
And I am working with Linear Regression, propably I will try out and use L1, L2 (Lasso, Ridge) noamrlizations.
This project will predict (estimate) price of your apartment and provide you with valuable insights according to your district and situation.
Stay tuned!
